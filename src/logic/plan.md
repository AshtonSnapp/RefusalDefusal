# Logic Plan

 - Timer:
  - Need time library

 - Meter:
  - Gets a boost whenever the player makes a mistake

 - Power:
  - If this runs down to 0%, it's game over! Wait a few seconds while the Meter speeds up.

 - Classes:
  - Robot Class:
  	- Contains the Timer and Meter, equates to the robot girlfriend
  - Helper Class:
  	- Used for characters which help the player out

 - Binary Coded Decimal for a code to lower the Robot's Meter when it gets red (last resort)

 -
