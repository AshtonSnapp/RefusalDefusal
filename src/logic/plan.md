# Logic Plan

 - Timer:
  - Need time library

 - Meter:
  - Gets a boost whenever the player makes a mistake

 - Power:
  - If this runs down to 0%, it's game over! Wait a few seconds while the Meter speeds up.

 - Classes:
  - Robot Class:
  	- Contains the Timer and Meter, equates to the robot girlfriend
  - Helper Class:
  	- Used for characters which help the player out
  		- Personalities: Caring dad, IT Technical Support, Drill Seargeant, Stoner Friend(s), Cajun Guy

 - Binary Coded Decimal for a code to lower the Robot's Meter when it gets red (last resort)

 * Game/GUI/Giant Loop
 	* Timer
 	* Robot/Antagonist
 	* Hardware I/O
 	* Helper/Hints

 - Banana Minigame Easter Egg (Ashton's Easter Egg, unlocked by clicking on the word "banana" in my Twitter handle, "@bananadevel0per", five times on the About Screen)
 	- Basically Space Invaders, Except They're Bananas.
